# RFM Analysis on Customer Data

This project performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis on customer transaction data to identify customer segments for marketing and retention strategies.

## 📌 Project Objective

To segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and value to the business using RFM metrics. This helps in identifying loyal, at-risk, and high-value customers.

## 🧠 RFM Metrics

- **Recency (R)**: Days since the customer’s last purchase
- **Frequency (F)**: Total number of purchases
- **Monetary (M)**: Total spending of the customer

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. RFM metric calculation
3. Scoring customers based on RFM
4. Segmenting customers into groups
5. Visualizing the distribution of scores using Seaborn plots

## 📁 Files

- `rfm_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full code, analysis, and visualizations
- `README.md` – You're reading it 😉

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn / Matplotlib for plotting
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (e.g. `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`)
3. Open `rfm_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode
